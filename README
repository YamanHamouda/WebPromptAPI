WebPrompt is a lightweight API that turns live web pages into usable AI context. A user sends a request with a URL and a prompt. The system fetches the page, strips away ads, navigation, and HTML noise, and extracts the core readable text. That cleaned content is then injected into the user’s prompt and sent to a large language model, such as AWS Bedrock, to generate a focused response.

The goal is to remove manual copy-paste and make it easy to reason over real web content using AI. WebPrompt is cheap to run, simple in scope, and designed as infrastructure rather than a full product. It works well for summarization, analysis, and writing tasks that depend directly on the content of a webpage.

dependencies:
beautifulsoup: `pip install beautifulsoup4` for web scraping
FastAPI: `pip install fastapi` for API creation
uvicorn: `pip install uvicorn` for hosting a fastAPI server

`cd src`; `python -m uvicorn main:API --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000;` can change to a different host or port
